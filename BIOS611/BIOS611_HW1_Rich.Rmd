## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




1.  What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
    ```
    
    Answer: The positioning of the parenthesis is causing the mapping function to look for an attribute called "blue" in the data.  The color selection must be moved outside the parenthisis.

    ```{r}
 library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
    ```

2.  Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
    (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How
    can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

    Answer: model, cyl, trans, drv, fl, and class are categorical

    ```{r}
?mpg
    
    ```

3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape`. How do
    these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous
    variables? 
    
    Answer: 

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty))
    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 

    Answer: Nothing breaks, but you do get unnecessary redundency in terms of information display

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ,size=displ))
    ```

5.  What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
    (Hint: use `?geom_point`)
    
    Answer: stroke lets us set a different fill color and outer stroke color and width

    ```{r}
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg,color=cyl))+
    geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 5, stroke =5)

    ```

6.  What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable 
    name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  

    Answer: Mappping an aesthetic with a cutoff value lets us redefine visually break points inside a given set of variables (e.g. showing all cars with a displacement of less than 5 liters in a different color from those at or above 5 liters)

    ```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ<5,size=displ))
    ```


# Exercise 2

1.  What do the empty cells in plot with `facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)` mean?
    How do they relate to this plot?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
    ```

    Answer: The empty cells indicate that there were no vehicles with a given combination of attributes (e.g. there were no 4 cylinder rear wheel drive vehicles in the dataset)

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What plots does the following code make? What does `.` do?

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(drv ~ .)
    
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
      facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
    ```

    Answer: 
    The first plot makes a facet grid in which each plot compares the displacement and highway MPGs of vehicles within categories based on drivetrain visualized as rows.
    The second plot makes a faced grid in which each plot compares the displacement and highway MPGs of vehicles within categories based on the number of cylinders the vehicle has visualized in columns.
    The "." allows us to categorize the plots based on a single variable rather than requiring that all plots be X by X

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Take the first faceted plot in this section:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
    ```
    
    What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
    What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a 
    larger dataset?
    
    Answer: 
    advantages: Using faceting declutters the visualization and enables the viewer to focus on comparisons within a single vehicle category more easily.
    disadvantages: Using faceting makes comparisons between vehicle categories more challenging and can slow cognitive processing by requiring the user to look at multiple plots rather than a single visualization.

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 3

1.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? 
    A histogram? An area chart?

    Answer: 
    line chart : geom_line
    boxplot : geom_boxplot
    histogram : geom_histogram
    area chart : geom_area

    ```{r}
?geom_area
    ```

2.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
    Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

    Answer: 
    Prediction: I expect to see points colored by drivetrain with displacement for x coordinates and highway MPGs for y coordinates.  I expect to see an overlaid regression line of displacement vs. Highway MPG for each drivetrain category, color coded the same as the points.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does `show.legend = FALSE` do?  What happens if you remove it?  
    Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}
 ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv),show.legend=FALSE) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
      
    ```

4.  What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do?


    Answer: 
    The se argument either allows or removes the standard error shaded region on a line plot

    ```{r}

    
    ```

5.  Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth()
    
    ggplot() + 
      geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

6.  Recreate the R code necessary to generate the following graphs.
    
    ![Smooth lines for each `drv`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306A.png?raw=true"`)
    
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```


    ![A single smooth line, transparency by `year`](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306B.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```

    
    ![Layered dots and an additional text information](`r "https://github.com/datasci611/datasci_src/blob/master/HW1P0306C.png?raw=true"`)
    
    Adding texts was not covered in class, but give it a try!
    
    Answer: 
    
    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

    ```

# Exercise 4

1.  What is the default geom associated with `stat_summary()`? How could
    you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the 
    stat function?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What variables does `stat_smooth()` compute? What parameters control
    its behaviour?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 5

1.  What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What parameters to `geom_jitter()` control the amount of jittering?

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  Compare and contrast `geom_jitter()` with `geom_count()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

# Exercise 6

1.  Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using `coord_polar()`.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  What does `labs()` do? Read the documentation.

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
    and highway mpg? Why is `coord_fixed()` important? What does 
    `geom_abline()` do?
    
    ```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%"}
    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point() + 
      geom_abline() +
      coord_fixed()
    ```

    Answer: 

    ```{r}

    ```
